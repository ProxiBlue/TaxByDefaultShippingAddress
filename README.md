# ProxiBlue_TaxByDefaultShippingAddress module

Simply sets the default shipping address as the tax address used for any tax calculations.

This module allows Hyva cart to use the logged-in user default shipping address
for cart tax lookup.

In luma, this is works already, however my fix involves an after plugin onto a core method.

I am sure there is a better 'hyva-way' to fix this, so this module exists as an interim solution.
